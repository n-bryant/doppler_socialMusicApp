Doppler is a mock-up of a responsive social media app that focuses around sharing songs. Doppler was built using Angular 1.5, compiled with gulp, and uses local storage to cache user data. The songs available are selections from a few of my favorite bands. The data for the songs came from Spotify's Web API.
